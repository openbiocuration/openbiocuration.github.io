<a name="welcome-to-open-biocuration" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-open-biocuration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Open Curation GitHub community.</h3>

<p>We are a community of open source developers in the field of <em>biocuration</em>,
committed to building tools that support the design and construction of bioinformatics 
resources for the broader scientific community. The purpose of this GitHub community 
is to provide a central, easily-accessible set of repositories of tools that scientists 
and developers can practically use to make their work easier. It also provides a loose 
framework for collaboration between biocuration developers.</p>

<p>The idea for this project was put together on the last day of the 
<a href="http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-iv/">BiocCreative IV</a>
meeting in October 2013, Bethesda MD as a place for attendees of that meeting to collaborate. 
This also reflects the vision put forward at the 
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/projects/sciknowmine/sciknowmine_release_workshop_-_bridging_bionlp_and_biocuration">SciKnowMine 2013 meeting</a>
as a <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2010/09/steven-johnson-the-liquid-network-of-ideas.html">'liquid network'</a>
that encourages the innovative generation of new ideas.</p>

<p>There are several things you can do here:</p>

<h3>
<a name="tool developer" class="anchor" href="#tool developer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
If you are a tool developer...
</h3>

<p>Start by letting us know what you're doing and then maybe join us and share your code.
We'd prefer it if you shared only release code here, rather than  maintaining a 
bleeding-edge version of your system (you have your own github page for that). But 
nonetheless, if you have a tool that provides functionality, passes all it's unit tests 
(<em>you do have some unit tests, right?</em>) and has good documentation that other 
developers might want to use, then, please, join us and share it here.</p>

<h3>
<a name="system developer" class="anchor" href="#system developer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
If you are a bioinformatics system developer...</h3>

<p>Please, use our code! Our goal is to save you a whole bucketload of time in (a) finding 
effective tools, (b) building and deploying tools, and (c) maintaining tools for your 
system. We want this community to be a one stop shop for you when you're trying to make 
your biocurators' lives just a little happier. We could all do with some of that. </p>

<h3>
<a name="biocurator" class="anchor" href="#biocurator"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
If you are a biocurator...</h3>

<p>Please, tell us what you think! Ultimately, we're going to be trying to serve you. 
Naturally, you are the ultimate authority on what works and what doesn't work so keep 
in touch and let us know what you like. </p>

<h3>
<a name="researcher" class="anchor" href="#researcher"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
If you are an NLP (or other CS) researcher...</h3>

<p>If you've got an interesting project that could you think could develop into a 
practical system, we'd like to help. There may be platforms, annotation systems and 
fully developed packages here that could provide you with a way of getting your fantastic
new research ideas into use as a viable research project. Please talk to us, we'll set you up. </p>
